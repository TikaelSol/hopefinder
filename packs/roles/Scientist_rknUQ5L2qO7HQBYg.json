It was rewarding work and you really had a chance at a breakthrough, until it all came apart. Now you can only tinker on the work that was once your passion. Maybe one day, your work will save the world.</p>\n<p><strong>Research</strong> (Exploration) There is not a problem you cannot solve by doing a little research. By spending 1 hour using a working computer or a research library, you can attempt any Lore skill check as if you were trained in that skill or give yourself a +2 circumstance bonus on the check if you are trained or higher in that Lore skill. You can also use this ability whenever you attempt a check to Recall Knowledge to give yourself a +2 circumstance bonus on the check.</p>\n<p><strong>Skills</strong>: Increase your Computers or Machinery by 1 step.</p>\n<p><strong>Feats</strong>: You can select Agility, Healing, or Technology.</p>",
