The narrator determines what maneuvers are possible at your speed and the DC of this check. On a success, you perform the maneuver. On a failure, you crash, the vehicle takes damage (typically [[/r 1d6 #Dings]] dings), but it is otherwise still functional. On a critical failure the crash deals [[/r 2d6 #Dings]] dings and the nature of the mishap prevents it from functioning without further repairs or checks (perhaps you drove into a ditch and are stuck, or you have a flat tire).</p>",
