      "value": "<p>You can cook raw food to make it last longer and sterilize water to make it safe to drink (at least from parasites and other water born contagions). Spend 10 minutes with a fire and cooking implements, then attempt a Survival skill check. The DC is typically 10, but it might be higher if your tools are poor or the situation is making it difficult. On a success you can make expired canned good safe to eat or turn raw meat or fresh vegetables into cooked meat or cooked vegetables. These take twice as long to spoil. If you have a source of water that is not contaminated with chemicals, you can also use this time to create 1 gallon of drinking water.</p>",
