The number of actions is dependent on the weapon, but unlike other activities, these do not need to be consecutive. The first action is to always drop the clip out of the weapon, leaving at most 1 round in the chamber if it is a gun. Additional actions are to draw and slot in the new cartridge, and then to load the weapon. This can take one to three additional actions.</p>",
