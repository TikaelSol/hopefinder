      "value": "<p>You spend 10 minutes erecting a quick barrier or obstacle using junk and debris from the surrounding area. This barrier blocks one edge of a square and must be anchored to solid objects on both sides (usually a door frame, but between a pair of heavy desks might also work). Attempt a @Check[type:crafting|dc:15|immutable:true] skill check. On a success the barrier has break value of 1 and the DC to force it open is a 10. On a critical success, double the break value and increase the DC by 5. You can elect to increase the DC of the Craft check by 5 to increase the first break value by 1 and the DC to force it open by 5. You can use this action up to 3 times on barrier to increase its break value (but you still only use the highest force open DC).</p>",
