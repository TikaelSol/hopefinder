Attempt a Computers or Machinery skill check (DC set by the narrator based on the complexity of the device). On a success you gain basic control over the system and can make it do any of the things it was designed to do (make a vending machine spit out beverages, redirect a CCTV system, etc). On a critical success you can make it do something that it was not meant to do but within its capabilities.</p>",
