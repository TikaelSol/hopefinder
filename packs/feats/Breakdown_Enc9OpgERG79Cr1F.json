Target one computer or device that you are adjacent to and attempt a Computers or Machinery skill check (DC set by the narrator based on the complexity of the device). On a success you can shut down the device, causing it to stop working in whatever state it is in at that moment (a door that was closed would stay closed). On a critical success you can change the final state of the device before it stops functioning (cause a tractor to roll forward 20 feet before its engine dies).</p>",
