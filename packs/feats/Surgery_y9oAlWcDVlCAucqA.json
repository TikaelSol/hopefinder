      "value": "<p>You can perform surgery to heal other survivors. This takes at least 1 hour to perform, you must have a surgical kit, and at the end you must attempt a Medicine skill check. The DC depends on how many Hit Points the target had remaining at the start of the operation (@Check[type:medicine|dc:25] if at less than 1/4, @Check[type:medicine|dc:20] if at less than 1/2, @Check[type:medicine|dc:15] if at less than 3/4, and @Check[type:medicine|dc:10] if at more than 3/4). If successful, you heal the target for half of the Hit Points it is missing (3/4 on a critical success). You do not need a sedative if the target has more than half its Hit Points at the start of the operation, but otherwise this check takes a -4 if the target is not @Compendium[pf2e.conditionitems.Unconscious]{Unconscious}.</p>",
