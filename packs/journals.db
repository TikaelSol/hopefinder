It doesn't include the full rules of Hopefinder, instead it aims to make implementing those rules as easy as possible. The base PF2e system is very flexible, and while there are some limitations in what can be automated fully, the module adds reminders, automates new traits, and helps in building characters.</p><p>To start, simply drag the @UUID[Compendium.hopefinder.features.sTzZLHXyu4UuQZeJ]{Survivor} class item onto a PC and follow the prompts. While Hopefinder is a game system without classes, this module uses the Survivor class item to add the baseline automation to the sheet. You can find this class item in the \"Hopefinder - Features\" compendium.</p><p>Once you have followed the prompts add the @Compendium[pf2e.ancestries.IiG7DgeLWYrSNXuX]{Human} ancestry to your sheet and one of the backgrounds from the \"Hopefinder - Backgrounds\" compendium. Because Hopefinder does not use the normal rules for ability boosts the prompts will handle ability boosts for you rather than using the ability score manager in the sheet.</p><p>When your party has their first flashback they can select their Roles from the \"Hopefinder - Roles\" compendium.</p><p>Narrators should enable the Hopefinder feats from the compendium browser Load Packs tab. Not every feat a player can choose comes from Hopefinder, skill feats from Pathfinder are available at the Narrator's discretion.</p><p>Additionally, Hopefinder adds new skills to the game. Currently the PF2e system has no way to add new skills in properly, but we can use Lore skills to add them. Add the \"Machinery\", \"Computers\", and \"Driving\" skills to the player sheets under lores. If you name them exactly as listed here the automation on the Survivor class item will adjust them to use the correct ability score.</p><p>If you encounter an issue with this module, please submit an issue on the github page for the module and I'll fix it as soon as I'm able.</p><p></p><p>Thanks for playing!</p><p>-Tikael</p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"ownership":{"default":0,"wzla4PE5p61vlV6O":3},"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.oSE7ZyTlnkif3fKs"},"hopefinder":{"isHopefinder":true}},"_stats":{"systemId":"pf2e","systemVersion":"4.5.1","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1671411443714,"modifiedTime":1672180350591,"lastModifiedBy":"wzla4PE5p61vlV6O"},"folder":null,"sort":0,"_id":"7NSV1EbfvS7tOwls"}
